# Enhanced Avatar Chatbot System
*Transforming Response Delays into Engaging Moments*

An open-source Unity project that reimagines LLM response latency as an opportunity for **human-like engagement**.  
We are not just solving delay. we’re delivering a **complete AI-powered, avatar-enhanced chatbot platform**.  
Built with flexible, modular design techniques, the system can be **easily adapted to any domain**:  
from **business customer support** and **medical consultation** to **English teaching**, virtual training, or any interactive service that benefits from natural, emotionally rich conversations.  
Real-time speech processing, emotion-driven animations, and a companion pet avatar ensure that every interaction feels engaging, professional, and alive.

## 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out

### 🎤 High-Fidelity Speech Pipeline
- **Accuracy:** Whisper STT consistently delivers **>95% transcription accuracy**, even with accents or background noise.  
- **Natural Voice:** ElevenLabs TTS produces **studio-quality, emotion-aware speech**, so every response sounds warm and lifelike.

### 💫 Emotion System with Precision & Depth
- Detects **5 core emotions** (*joy, anger, sadness, fear, neutral*) with graded intensity (*low, medium, high*).  
- Animations use detailed **blend-shapes** and **VFX** for subtle expressions like blinking, micro-smiles, and realistic eye movement.

### ⏳ Tiered Delay Handling
- **1 s** → Friendly filler keeps the conversation flowing.  
- **3 s** → Emotion-based filler mirrors the user’s mood.  
- **5 s+** → Companion Pet animation adds playful, **high-frame-rate (60 FPS)** visuals that reduce perceived wait time by **over 30% in user tests**.

### 📚 Research-Backed Design
- Based on a **Master’s thesis** and **Pacific Graphics 2025 paper**.  
- Two user studies (**40+ participants**) showed **significant boosts in engagement and satisfaction**, proving the system’s impact.

### 🏗 Production-Grade Build Quality
- Built in **Unity 2022 LTS** with **modular C# scripts** for easy maintenance.  
- Smooth 3D rendering and **low-latency pipeline (~1.5 s end-to-end)** ensure professional responsiveness.
