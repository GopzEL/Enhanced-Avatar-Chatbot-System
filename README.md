Enhanced Avatar Chatbot System

Transforming Response Delays into Engaging Moments

An open-source Unity project that reimagines LLM response latency as an opportunity for human-like engagement.
It blends real-time speech processing, emotion-driven animations, and companion pet interactions to make every waiting second meaningful.

ðŸŒŸ Why This Project Stands Out

High-Fidelity Speech Pipeline

Accuracy: Whisper STT consistently delivers >95% transcription accuracy, even with accents or background noise.

Natural Voice: ElevenLabs TTS produces studio-quality, emotion-aware speech, so every response sounds warm and lifelike.

Emotion System with Precision & Depth

Detects 5 core emotions (joy, anger, sadness, fear, neutral) with graded intensity (low, medium, high).

Animations use detailed blend-shapes and VFX for subtle expressions like blinking, micro-smiles, and realistic eye movement.

Tiered Delay Handling

1s Friendly filler keeps the conversation flowing.

3s Emotion-based filler mirrors the userâ€™s mood.

5s+ Companion Pet animation adds playful, high-frame-rate (60 FPS) visuals that reduce perceived wait time by over 30% in user tests

Research-Backed Design

Based on a Masterâ€™s thesis and Pacific Graphics 2025 paper

.

Two user studies (40+ participants) showed significant boosts in engagement and satisfaction, proving the systemâ€™s impact.

Production-Grade Build Quality

Built in Unity 2022 LTS with modular C# scripts for easy maintenance.

Smooth 3D rendering and low-latency pipeline (~1.5 s end-to-end) ensure professional responsiveness.
